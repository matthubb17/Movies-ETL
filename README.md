# Movies-ETL

## Project Overview:

The goal of this project was to help Amazing Prime, the worlds largest online retailer, with their platform "Amazing Prime Video" that is used for straming movies and tv shows. The team would like to develop an algorithm to predict which low budget movies being released will become popular. In this project we worked to use wikipedia data, kaggle metadata, and MovieLens rating data and transform the data and load it into an existing PostgreSQL database.
